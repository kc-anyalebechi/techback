# TechBack

## User story
Many tech companies in the San Francisco Bay Area hire engineers and web developers who are not from the areas where they end up working.

This was known in theory but was really felt during the pandemic when all the major tech companies allowed their employees to work from home. This was great for them however devastating for local businesses. The main reason is that tech employees felt that paying 5,000 a month for rent and living states away from their families didn't make a lot of sense, so they moved back home.

During that time I was living in Mountain View California, and when this happened it seemed like every week a new business shut their doors for good. However this problem was not completely related to the pandemic. The pandemic only revealed a growing problem: The people that most tech companies hire are not from the community.

TechBack is a web application for organizations and individuals to give back with knowledge and presence to the communities where they serve.

With this app organizations and individuals can sign up to give webinars, seminars, masterclasses, or bootcamps to schools, non-profit, or churches in the communities where they work.
The mission is to expose communities and underserved demographics to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics from those who are currently working these fields.
