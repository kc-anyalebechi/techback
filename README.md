# TechBack

## User story
Many tech companies in the San Franscisco Bay Area hire engineers and web developers who are not from the areas where they end up working. This was known in theory but was really felt during the pandemic when all the major tech companies allowed their employess to work from home. This was great for them however devistating for local businseses. The main reason is become tech employees felt that paying 5,000 a month for rent and living states away from their families didnt make a lot of sense, so they moved back home. During that thime I was living in Mountain View California, and when this happened it seemed like every week a new business shut their doors for good. However this problem didnt with the pandemic. The pandemic only revealed a growing problem: The people that most tech companies hire are not from the community.
